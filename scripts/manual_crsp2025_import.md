# CRSP 2025 Import Status and Solution

## Current Situation
- **Total CRSP 2025 records in CSV**: 5,300
- **Successfully imported**: 157 records (3%)
- **Missing records**: 5,143 records (97%)

## Problem Analysis
The bulk import is failing due to WebSocket connection limitations with the Neon database. Large batch operations exceed connection limits.

## Current CRSP 2025 Data Coverage
- **Makes available**: 15 (AUDI, VOLVO, VOLKSWAGEN, BMW, XPENG, BENTLEY, etc.)
- **Models available**: 142 unique models
- **Most complete make**: AUDI (93 vehicles)

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Batch Import (Recommended)
Use the SQL execute tool to import data in small batches of 10-20 records at a time.

Example command:
```sql
INSERT INTO vehicle_references_2025 (make, model, model_number, transmission, drive_configuration, engine_capacity, body_type, gvw, seating, fuel_type, crsp_2025) VALUES 
('MAKE1', 'MODEL1', 'NUMBER1', 'AT', 'FWD', '1500', 'SEDAN', NULL, '5', 'GASOLINE', 5000000),
('MAKE2', 'MODEL2', 'NUMBER2', 'AT', 'AWD', '2000', 'SUV', NULL, '7', 'GASOLINE', 7000000);
```

### Option 2: Use CRSP 2020 Data
The CRSP 2020 dataset is fully imported with 3,687 records across multiple makes and is currently functional.

### Option 3: Progressive Import Script
A background script could slowly import remaining records over time to avoid connection limits.

## Current Functionality Status
- **CRSP 2020**: ✅ Fully functional (3,687 records)
- **CRSP 2025**: ⚠️ Partial (157 records)
- **API endpoints**: ✅ Working for both datasets
- **Vehicle selection**: ✅ Working with available data

## Impact on User Experience
Users can still use the duty calculator effectively by:
1. Selecting CRSP 2020 for comprehensive vehicle coverage
2. Using CRSP 2025 for the limited available vehicles (mainly AUDI models)
3. Manual entry for vehicles not in database

## Next Steps
1. Continue using CRSP 2020 for reliable calculations
2. Gradually import more CRSP 2025 data using manual SQL batches
3. Consider implementing a background import job for remaining records
