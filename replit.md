- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)

- **Location Types**: 
  - "Locally Available" (Kenya-based with county/area selection)
  - "Overseas" (international locations with manual entry)
- **Auto-Population**: County selection automatically loads relevant areas from database
- **Formatted Output**: Combines specific location, area, and county for complete address

## Key Components
